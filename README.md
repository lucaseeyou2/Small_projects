* [Linear-Gradient Generator](#Linear)

## Linear Gradient Generator
This is a basic linear-gradient generator using two color inputs. This creates a gradient from the first color and the second. There is also a function for it to choose 
a completely random rotation and color to create a new gradient. Previously generated gradients are in the console with both hex codes and rotation degree.
