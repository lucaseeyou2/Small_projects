* [Linear-Gradient Generator](#linear-gradient-generator)

## Linear Gradient Generator
This is a basic linear-gradient generator using two color inputs. This creates a gradient from the first color and the second. There is also a function for it to choose 
a completely random rotation and color to create a new gradient. Previously generated gradients are in the console with both hex codes and rotation degree. This project 
was built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. It was fun and simple to build due to the simple JavaScript behind it.
