# Small projects
Small projects that do not deserve their own repository to be included in. Most of these do not require a library and are free to use accordingly to the ***MIT license***. These projects will be included in their own personal folder for more reference. Here are the current projects available for view, and more may come:

## Linear Gradient Generator
This is a basic linear-gradient generator using two color inputs. This creates a gradient from the first color and the second. There is also a function for it to choose a completely random rotation and color to create a new gradient. Previously generated gradients are in the console with both HEX codes and rotation degree. This project was built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. It was fun and simple to build due to the simple JavaScript behind it.

## Universal Time clock
This is an universal time clock. Bacicly, it gets the time and date from many different locations on this planet. The timezone offset will be calculated with UTC time. The clock makes usage of the `Date();` Javascript object and its associated methods. Also, this is vanilla Javascript, no external libraries are required to run this page. CSS3 and HTML5 are also in this project. Note : currently this project is unfinished I could get some help to finish it if anyone wants to. 

## Code editor
This was something I wanted to make for a long time. This is a code editor that can run HTML CSS and JavaScript. To explain this, the editor is like any code editor, but its basic with only one feature : to write code. To use this, write your HTML code inside this editor. Once this done, click the run button below, it will open an external window that contains your writtings inside it. Currently, it is usable, but more features may come in the near future.
