# Linear gradient generator
This is a project made from vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. It takes the color values of two inputs and returns a linear-gradient CSS. There is also a function for a 
random gradient to be generated and this will create two different hex values and a custom rotation value ranging from 1 to 360. <br>
