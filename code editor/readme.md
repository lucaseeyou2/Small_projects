# Code editor
This was something I wanted to make for a long time. This is a code editor that can run HTML CSS and JavaScript. To explain this, the editor is like any code editor, but its basic with only one feature : to write code. To use this, write your HTML code inside this editor. Once this done, click the run button below, it will open an external window that contains your writtings inside it. Currently, it is usable, but more features may come in the near future.
